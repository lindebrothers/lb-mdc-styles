## Typography

#### Fonts for text and headlines
```txt
Roborto
```

#### Fonts for system, inputs, buttons, lists, tables etc
```txt
Roborto
```
If we think of elements such buttons, inputs, menus, drop-downs etc, as component that belongs to the system or the browser, we should not try to restyle them too much. Instead, user has often seen Material design styled components before, so restyling them may only confuse them. *Roborto* is the default font for these kind of components. And that is why *Roborto* is default here as well.

#### Fonts for icons
```txt
Material-icons
```
